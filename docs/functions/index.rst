Functions
=========

Functions are the building blocks for customizable guis in DynamicGui.
With functions you can customize `guis <../gui>`_ and `slots <../slot>`_.
Below are the built-in functions for DynamicGui, addons may add more.
If you are interested in making functions take a look at the `developer docs <../functionapi>`_.
